Welcome to my Java game development series!

This series will go over creating a 2D game engine and a game using said engine. But it won't be your typical, archaic AWT type of game tutorial.

Let's go over the features we will work towards:

* The entire engine will be completely modular.
  - Every piece like the renderer and sound system will be swappable
  - The engine will support user-created plugins from the ground up. This means mod support without any extra effort, and no need for modders to have complex bytecode-manipulation toolchains.
* It will have the full featureset of an RPG engine
  - Think RPG Maker. RPG engines are complex beasts with a ton of features that can be applies to a lot of different types of games. This engine will work for 2D top-down games and platformers, ideally.
